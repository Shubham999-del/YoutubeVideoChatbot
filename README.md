🎥 YouTube Video Summarizer & Q&A Chatbot (RAG-based)
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered application that allows users to input a YouTube video URL and ask intelligent queries about its content, such as:

📝 "Summarize the whole content"

💡 "Explain what all points were discussed regarding deep learning"

❓ "What are the key takeaways from this video?"

This tool uses the video’s transcript to create a conversational interface that responds intelligently to user queries.

🚀 Features
🔗 Accepts YouTube video URLs

📄 Extracts and stores transcript data

🧠 Indexes the transcript in a vector database

💬 Provides a chat interface to ask context-aware questions

⚡ Answers are generated using RAG (context + generative LLM)

🧰 Tech Stack
Component	Tech Used
Backend	Python, LangChain, FastAPI
LLM	Open-source / OpenAI model
Vector DB	FAISS / Pinecone / Chroma
Transcript Fetch	youtube-transcript-api
Frontend	Streamlit (or Gradio/React)
Embeddings	Sentence Transformers / OpenAI Embeddings
Summarization	LLM + custom prompt templates

📦 Installation
bash

Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-rag-chatbot.git
cd youtube-rag-chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
🧪 How It Works
User Inputs YouTube URL

Video transcript is fetched using youtube-transcript-api.

Transcript is Preprocessed

Text is chunked and converted into embeddings.

Storage in Vector DB

Embeddings are stored in a vector database for retrieval.

User Asks a Query

Query is converted into an embedding and compared with stored ones.

RAG Pipeline Runs

Retrieved relevant chunks + query are passed to the LLM.

Final response is generated.

🖥️ Usage (Streamlit UI)
To launch the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
📌 Example Prompts

"Summarize the whole video"
"What are the key ideas discussed in the middle of the video?"
"Explain the part where the speaker talks about deep learning."
"List the examples shared in the video regarding neural networks."

📈 Future Improvements
🧠 Add speaker diarization and timestamp-based segmentation

🗃️ Cache transcripts to reduce repeat API calls

🧩 Plug in more accurate models (Gemini, Claude, etc.)
